# gabz-casinowalls
A small script that starts the casino walls with PolyZone (for Gabz Casino)

If you use a script for your casino machines + games, if you add `TriggerEvent('chCasinoWall:bigWin')` to the winnings, the screens will show with gold confetti.

This script requires [PolyZone by mkafrin](https://github.com/mkafrin/PolyZone)
